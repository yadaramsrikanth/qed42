Description: 
 I have developed a e-commerce application. This application allows users to sort,selectproducts and add them to the shopping cart. I used react router for navigation with in the application. I used context for state management for creating a global state to manage cart access across routes. I intergrated API for displaying data. During API request, I displayed loading spinner from the third-party-package "react-loader-spinner". If API request is failed, I dispalyed a retry button. When we click retry button , the API request triggers and retrieves data from API. If API request is success, I displayed a list of items on the web page.
